StatBot
===

Usage:

Create a discord bot at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create

Put the token in a file called `token.txt`.

Run `main.py`.

You should be able to say `~~stats` in the same server as the bot and have it respond.

Requires pyxhook, discord.py, asyncio and psutil.

This probably won't work on windows.
